Dataset used for DH2019 Paper - Leveraging Historical Records to Understand Artist Career Success in 17th Century Rome

For this paper, I used a dataset compiled in 2012 by Richard Spear of University of Maryland.  Spear sought to create a dataset of commissions made to painters while working in Rome in the Seicento.  To create this dataset, Spear combed through 149 different reference sources and recorded details of commissions to artists by patrons for paintings made in Rome during the 17th century.   The dataset is maintained by the Getty Research Institute as part of its Collecting and Provenance Databases.  Using this dataset as a base, upon final cleaning and transformation, the final working dataset uses records from 149 different reference sources that detailed 818 commissions made to 129 different artists by 182 different patrons.  

The Excel file in this repository has one tab reflecting the original dataset as provided by the Getty and another tab reflecting the cleaned and transformed dataset used for analysis.  An online tool tracking the changes to each element can be found at https://tabsoft.co/2WQulHP.
